# Frontend Ops

An intro to frontend operations. This is an enormous field containing many
skillsets, but this presentation covers the "basics" of development workflow in
the context of building websites.

Other areas of expertise cover render performance, deploying JavaScript apps,
managing a product (instead of a site), team workflow, release management,
correlating regressions with code changes, and notifying teams automatically
when any of these become critical.
